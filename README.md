The Open Tor Botnet (ZIB) Official Release

Main information body
--
You need to use bitcoind.... I will not explain that.
ZIB is fully undetectable and bypasses all antivirus by running on top of Python27's pyinstaller, which is used for many legitimate programs. The only possibility of detection comes from the script, however, the script contains randomized-looking data through using a randomized AES key and initialization vector.
ZIB.py is the main project file. It has 2 errors so nobody who isn't qualified will compile it and do something hazardous.
intel.py is the chat bot, and it has 2 errors to prevent bad things from happening.
compileZIB.py is used by intel.py, started with chp.exe to run in the background.. 2 errors once again
ZIB_imports.txt contains all the imports for ZIB to use. They're appended to the script when compiling.
btcpurchases.txt includes all the bitcoin payments that are pending. Ones older than 24 hours are deleted.
channels.txt includes all completed BTC payments.
You want to point your webserver to dist\ for hosting the files.
chp.exe is required in the local dir.
For the IRC server, run bircd, set up an oper with the username Zlo and password RUSSIA!@#$RUSSIA!@#$RUSSIA!@#$RUSSIA!@#$. For the max users per ip set to 0 because tor users will look like 127.0.0.1Keep all scripts in Python27/Scripts.
Put nircmd in the local directory for editing file dates.

Notes
--
Yes, everything still links to the original website and IRC channel. (ewww)
The default server won't accept new channels, you have to buy one to host there.
This is probably filled with terrible information, non-commented code, etc... My apologies for this work of "art".
Yes, I wrote the README in 3 minutes without proof-reading. Just releasing ZIB real quick.
