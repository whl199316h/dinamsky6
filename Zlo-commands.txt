****** COMMANDS *****
!help - Display help
!auth [main_authentication_password] - enables you to control your bot network.
!newbin [main_authentication_password] - Generates you a new binary that's connected to your channel, which is saved in your settings server-side.
!buy - Purchase a channel slot. Comes with unlimited, undetectable, native binaries. Will automatically provide you with your authentication password, channel password, and channel name.
!recoverpassword [password] - Recovers channel password using your main authentication password.
!logout [password] - forces logout, even if you aren't in the channel. Good for security purposes.
!cmd [password] !botcommand - Runs a bot command through Zlo, without using !login/!logout. This method is much more safe and is impossible to steal a login session this way, so long as you check that Zlo is logged in as Zlo@Zlo, rather than Zlo@localhost or Zlo@127.0.0.1
NOTICE: Users who abuse these functions, i.e create 200 binaries per second and crash the server, will be permanently banned, without warning.
